FREEC Config File

#Sample config file below; 
# [general], [sample], [control], [BAF] and [target]. The last three can be empty if there is no control dataset available, if you do not intend to calculate BAF profiles and call genotypes, or if you are not running the program on targeted data (e.g. Whole Exome Sequencing).
